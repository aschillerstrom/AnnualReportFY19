In Fiscal Year 2019, 326 citizens participated in the Court's survey.  Of those, 98% found their interaction with the Court satisfactory or above.  Prospective jurors are also encouraged to complete a survey regarding their experience and interaction with the Court.  Over 5,000 jurors took the survey with over 99% describing the process going "as expected" or better.</h3>

During these clinics, citizens had the opportunity to consult with legal counsel free of charge in a neutral environment. As a result, 852 DPS Surcharge Waivers were granted based on economic criteria.</h3>

                    <h3>The Court has been active in ensuring there are multiple avenues to contact the court during and beyond regular business hours.  The Court is open before and after regular business hours Monday through Friday.  This includes access to hearing officers between 7:00 am and 6:00 pm and having access to a judge on Thursday night.  
                    <br> 
                    Over 300,000 contacts were made to the Court via email, telephonic and online communication.  Unlike many large courts, when communicating on the telephone or by using email, the citizen is communicating with court clerk who can explain all of the legal options available including alternative sentencing options.
                    <br>
                    In addition, the Court accepts requests for judicial information by fax and email, as well as in person.  The Court's open data portal also serves a trove of information that is accessible day and night.
